# MD Ahad Ali
## Software Engineer

I am MD Ahad Ali, a passionate and driven Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology from Yunnan University, China. With hands-on experience as a Freelance Software Engineer on Upwork, I specialize in designing, developing, and deploying full-stack web and mobile applications, as well as AI-integrated, cloud-native solutions.

I have a strong foundation in backend and frontend technologies including Python (Django, FastAPI), JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Vue.js, Node.js), and Flutter, along with tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and major cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. My work often involves architecting scalable microservice systems, building AI/ML solutions such as recommendation engines and object detection systems, and integrating advanced data pipelines using PyTorch, Pandas, and NumPy.

Previously, I served as a Teaching Assistant at Yunnan University, where I supported students in understanding complex concepts in computer architecture, conducted lab sessions, and contributed to the improvement of academic programs.

With advanced proficiency in English and Bangla and intermediate Chinese skills, I thrive in multicultural environments. I've been honored with multiple international awards, including the TAETEA International Student Scholarship and recognition in national innovation competitions in China.

Currently, I'm focused on deepening my expertise in Artificial Intelligence, contributing to open-source communities, and continuously growing through impactful projects that blend technology with purpose.
